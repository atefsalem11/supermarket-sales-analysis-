# Data Wrangling Report
## Supermarket Sales Analysis Project

### 1. Data Overview
- Dataset: Supermarket Sales Data
- Source: Internal POS System
- Time Period: [Dates covered in the dataset]
- Total Records: 1006
- Number of Features: 16

### 2. Initial Data Assessment
#### 2.1 Data Structure
The dataset contains the following columns:
- Invoice ID: Transaction identifier
- Branch: Store location identifier
- City Columns (Yangon, Naypyitaw, Mandalay): Branch location indicators
- Customer type: Member vs Normal
- Gender: Customer gender
- Product line: Category of products
- Unit price: Price per unit
- Quantity: Number of items purchased
- Tax 5%: Tax amount
- Total: Total transaction amount
- Date: Purchase date
- Time: Purchase time
- Payment: Payment method
- Rating: Customer satisfaction rating

#### 2.2 Data Quality Issues Identified
1. Data Type Inconsistencies:
   - Date and Time columns stored as strings
   - Price-related columns containing currency symbols
   - Numeric values stored as text

2. Data Format Issues:
   - Inconsistent date formats
   - Time values requiring standardization
   - Currency values requiring cleaning

3. Data Validation Requirements:
   - Range checks for ratings (1-5)
   - Positive values for prices and quantities
   - Valid payment methods
   - Consistent branch codes

### 3. Data Cleaning Process
#### 3.1 Data Type Conversions
```python
# Date and Time Standardization
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])
df['Time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Time'], format='%H:%M').dt.time

# Numeric Conversions
df['Unit price'] = pd.to_numeric(df['Unit price'], errors='coerce')
df['Total'] = pd.to_numeric(df['Total'], errors='coerce')
```

#### 3.2 Data Validation Steps
1. Missing Value Analysis:
   - Checked all columns for null values
   - No missing values found in critical columns
   - Validated completeness of transaction records

2. Duplicate Check:
   - Verified unique Invoice IDs
   - Checked for duplicate transactions
   - No significant duplication issues found

3. Value Range Validation:
   - Confirmed all prices are positive
   - Verified quantity values are reasonable
   - Validated rating scores within 1-5 range

### 4. Feature Engineering
#### 4.1 New Features Created
1. Temporal Features:
   - Month extracted from Date
   - Day of week added
   - Time of day categorization

2. Financial Metrics:
   - Revenue per item calculation
   - Profit margin estimation (20% assumption)
   - Transaction value categorization

3. Customer Insights:
   - Customer type segmentation
   - Purchase frequency metrics
   - Rating categorization

### 5. Data Quality Assurance
#### 5.1 Validation Tests
1. Business Rule Validation:
   - Total amount = Unit price Ã— Quantity + Tax
   - Branch codes match city indicators
   - Valid payment methods present

2. Statistical Validation:
   - Outlier detection in prices
   - Transaction amount distribution analysis
   - Rating distribution verification

#### 5.2 Data Consistency Checks
1. Temporal Consistency:
   - Business hours verification
   - Date range validation
   - Seasonal pattern analysis

2. Categorical Consistency:
   - Product line categorization
   - Payment method standardization
   - Customer type classification

### 6. Final Dataset Structure
The cleaned and processed dataset includes:
- Original features: 16 columns
- Engineered features: 5 new columns
- Total records: 1006 (no data loss)
- All data types properly converted
- Consistent formatting across all fields

### 7. Recommendations
1. Data Collection Improvements:
   - Standardize date/time input formats
   - Implement automated validation rules
   - Add product subcategories

2. Data Quality Monitoring:
   - Regular duplicate checking
   - Automated range validation
   - Consistent format validation

3. Feature Enhancement:
   - Add customer demographics
   - Include product inventory data
   - Track promotional information

### 8. Technical Implementation
The data wrangling process was implemented using:
- Python 3.8+
- pandas for data manipulation
- numpy for numerical operations
- Regular quality assurance scripts
- Automated validation checks
